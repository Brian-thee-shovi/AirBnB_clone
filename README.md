<h1>Airbnb collaborative project</h1>
<h2>First Step: Writing a command interpreter to manage all my AirBnB objects</h2>
<p>This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>BaseModel</code>: Put in place a parent class to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances.</li>
  <li><code>Serialization/Deserialization Flow</code>: Create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance &lt;-&gt; Dictionary &lt;-&gt; JSON string &lt;-&gt; file.</li>
  <li><code>AirBnB Classes</code>: Create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Placeâ€¦) that inherit from BaseModel.</li>
  <li><code>Storage Engine</code>: Create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.</li>
  <li><code>Unit Tests</code>: Create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine.</li>
</ul>
